# Leveling equation

`C = 0.25` // const

`level = C * sqrt(exp)`

## Having level `l`, get next level exp boundary

`nextLevelExp = ((l + 1) / C) ** 2`


### TODO: find better logarithmic function for experience

-> Find a few optimal points (level wrt experience)
-> Find a best solution using optimization technique
